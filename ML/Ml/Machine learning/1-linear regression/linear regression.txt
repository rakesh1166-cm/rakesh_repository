regression analysis===process of predicting label or dependent variable  based on independent vraiable
casual effect relation ship
difference between actual data point from curve line  should be minimum
impact of multiple independent variable
find a best fit regression line
==============
reading data file
reading first  five row from dataset
how sales effect on independent variable tv, radio,newspaper
find total no of row and colunm
find data information to know data type and no of null value
find count the missing value of different colunm
visualize the relationship between feature and response using scatter plot
draw a  3 subplot using scatter to find best fit line
multiple linear regression==formulla
train the model
first create object for linear regression model
seprate label and target
then train model using linear regression object and fit label and target
find predict sales,radio and newspaper
find r2_score
======================================
Another examples
understand data high level
find chance of admission based on gre ,tofel score,university rating
 observe data using data.describe
fill null value by mean and mode
find how data is distributed
find data is distributed normally or not using scatter plot and for loop
get label and feature == get feature by drop label/target
 print x and y seprately 
analyze feature are linearly regretted are not and  get how many outlier present usinf for loop and scatter plot
if too many outlier present  then standardize data
standardize data by calculate x, standard scalar , scaled_mean by crateing standard scalar object then fit transform features
split the data train and test and calculate x_train,x_test,y_train and y_test  and order must be same
print y_train_head
print data.tail
after trained the model examine ur model give correct prediction by taking single row and regression_predictand scalar_transform
save the model for later use and  for correct prediction
saving the model to local file system
how well model fits the on trained and test data to know how less outlier present so that find r adjusted score
evaluation of model by MAE, andMSE, root MSE to  know  avg outlier
=========================================
Regulization
solve overfitting of training data
by rdducing degree of polynomial by reducing the no pf weight
small change of weight large difference for dependent variable
lasso==sum of magnitude of coefiicient
ridge==sum of square of magnitude of coefficient
lasso give zero impotance feature that effects our predicted data tp calculate target or label like skill,age
cross validation ==how many times u read or validate
lasso cv,alpha,max_iteration
lassocv--best alpha after max iteration
alpha-learning rate
iteration==maximize accuracy,minimize error rate
more iteration more accuracy
min-max-scaling== minimize range between 0 to 1
lasso cv for max iteration
best alpha parameter
how well data fitted before
find lasso regression score

my model is overfit if new set of data is coming in database
similarly ridge regression
