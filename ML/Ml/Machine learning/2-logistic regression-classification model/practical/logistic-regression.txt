logistic regression  is used for classification
read dataset
know how many row and col
get to know  min ,max,count and standard
how data is distributed for every colunm by plotting plot using for loop
get  feature by droping target
visualize outlier by plotting plot
check data is distrubed normally or not  more dependency is good to predict
check outlier how many,check left and right skew
draw boxplot to clear idea about outlier
find q1,q3,and and iqr
find higher and lower value 
anything above higher and  less than lower value  delete it as they are outlier
using scatter plot we found  outlier is present age,blod pressure,sickthickness,pregnancies so apply outlier detection only those feature
keep only those feature relation ship with label
find multicolinearity problem  check wheather one feature is dependent on other are not
for this first find x_scaled using standard scalar object
find vif for each x_scaled colunm using for loop and range
if vif of each scaled colunm less than 5 then no multivolinearity issues exist
preprocessing steps completed
=========model building===================
split train and test
create logistic regression object
fit logistic regression object
get y_prediction
find accuracy score for test and y pred
find conf matrix and classification report 9507527427
find roc and auc curve
to find roc and auc get tpr,fpr and roc
find auc score and roc score
for classificatio==accuracy,auc,roc,f1 score,conf matrix,precision
========================knn==================================================
find the value of k
find euclidian distance
lazy learner
pros and cons of knn algorithms
find type of cancer b or m
find data type wheather it is continous 
check sum of null value ineach colunm
select kbest  feature selection
now model building
to find accuracy use metric_score function
if overfiit applyy cross validation
k fold
 hold and out 
bias ,variance
