read csv,draw scatter plot of datapoints
convert x value to 2dimensional to fit in linear regression
trained given data on linear regression object to generate model
predict single element or whole dataframe
calculate coefieint,intercept y=mx+c
draw best fit line on scatter plot
Linear Regression With multiple Variable
fill null value using median and mode
draw scatter plot of data sets then draw best fit  line on them Loop through the independent variables(array of col of dataframe) and create scatter plots =independent variable,color,marker
how to save  then read then load model
