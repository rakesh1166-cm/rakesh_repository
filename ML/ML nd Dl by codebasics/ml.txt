ml dummy variable and one hot encoding
How to handle text data======
 ml is good to handle numerical data how to handle text data text data handled my encoding
dummy varible rule==
if u have 5 dummy variable then drop one and keep 2 dummy varible
if u have 3 dummy variable then drop one and keep 2 dummy variable
how to check how much difference betwwn actual output and and desired output or check accuracy=====
model.score(x,y)
when we use dummy variable and one hot encoding scheme==============
Dummy Variable: Use when you have a binary categorical variable or when creating a reference category in multi-category situations for regression models.
One-Hot Encoding: Use when you have a categorical variable with multiple categories, and you need to represent each category distinctly without assuming any ordinal relationship.
creating refrence varible of dataframe=======
dfle = df
how to covert dataframe to 2 dimensional array=========
2 ways
X = dfle[['town','area']].values
ohe(x).toarray()
Before ohe why label encoding is reqd=========
Label encoding is a useful intermediate step that simplifies the process of transforming categorical text data into a format suitable for one-hot encoding
TRAIN and TEST============
x_train prin randam variable fron dataset
if u want not to change x-train data specify random state
logistic===============
for linear regression we use linear approach y=mx+c
for logistic regression we use sigmoid or logit approach
