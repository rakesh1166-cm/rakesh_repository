Introduction to machine learning ##########################===================
in traditional program for developer programming language
human atask=== input and program
machine==output
in amazon/flipkart e commerce website== when we search sports data it display data 
but in machine learning when we next time login it without search show recent search sports data
in machine learning program
human atask=== input and output( in dataset input and output both available)
machine== program using model ,train and test
objective of ML== to reduce error b/w desired output and actual output
classic and adaptive system===========#############
based on input generate output like robot ex- software developer prog lang
based on input and feedback(backpropgation) like data set generate output in MACHINE LEARNING
TRAINING and TESTING PHASE==============###############
entire dataset divides train and test like 75 % data for train and 25 % data for test
in train data (75%)we we give input and output both to model it trained and generate program
in above generated models and program, we feed input from test data (25%) then  get desired output 
in dataset output of test data y' called actual output. then we compare difference b/w desired 
output and actual output  is called error
OVERFITTING and UNDERFITTING=================###############
given screenshot plot output is generated model/program after training phase
if generated model/program try to covers all data points of dataset is said to be overfitting
given screenshot plot output is generated model/program after training phase  cover very less data points 
on draw plot or bestfit line is underfitting
 REAL EXAMPLE==
after training phase i generated one model that test the data based on if it is shape of sphere is said to be ball, 
in testing phase i put orange that is also sphere shape on generated model after training phase then this model
 said orange to ball is wrong here we are put only one feature or condition that is sphere  so it is underfitting
overfitting === to many condition sphere 
Sphere (checked)==right
To Play (checked)==right
not To Eat (checked)==right
Radius = 5 cm (marked with a cross)==wrong

now i put ball on genereated model  first 3 condition ok but 4th condition fail so it rejected it is
 not ball that is wrong here i put too many condition so it is overfitting
