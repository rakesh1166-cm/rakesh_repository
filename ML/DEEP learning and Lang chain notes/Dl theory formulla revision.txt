how sigmoid and logit function better than linear regression in DL=================================
https://www.debug.school/rakeshdevcotocus_468/sigmoid-and-logit-functions-are-often-preferred-over-a-linear-regression-for-binary-classification-5cag
why linear regression is not suitable for classification task
Define logits function.
how sigmoid provides bounded output and non linearity concept.
linear or sigmoid is better for model capture more complex relationships in the data.
how sigmoid function converts linear equation output to range between 0 to 1

Short Notes
load datasets then extract training and test set data from mnist.load_data
perform scaling to convert train data values matrix between range 0 to 1 to improve accuracy and rgb to black and white
After scaling train and test dataset,convert 3 dimensional array to 2 dimensional(in tabular form row and colm) using flattening flattening train and test dataset because f you are using a fully connected dense layer, you must flatten your 3D input (e.g., (28, 28) into 784) before passing it to the network

model building or configuration=>10 output,784 input and sigmoid as it is output layer and use only one fully connected layer
compile means optimization then trained and test using fit
